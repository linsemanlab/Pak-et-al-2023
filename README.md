This repository contains source code and data files for the following paper: "Non-canonical Metabolic and Molecular Effects of Calorie Restriction Are Revealed by Varying Temporal Conditions". 

The folder "data" contains all the data required to recreate each figure for the metabolomics/proteomics data. 

R scripts for cleaning/normalizing the datasets, analyzing the data, and creating figures are included in the repository:

- The script "Met_Data_Cleaning_Pak_2023.R" contains code used to clean and normalize the metabolomics data. 

- The script "Pro_Data_Cleaning_Pak_2023.R" contains code used to clean and normalize the proteomics data. 

- The script "Met_T_Tests_Fold_Changes_Pak_2023.R" contains code used to run t-tests and fold-change analyses for the volcano plots for the metabolomics    data. 

- The script "Pro_T_Tests_Fold_Changes_Pak_2023.R" contains code used to run t-tests and fold-change analyses for the volcano plots for the proteomics data. 

- The script "Met_PCA_Pak_2023.R" contains code used to run PCA analyses for the metabolomics data. 

- The script "Pro_PCA_Pak_2023.R" contains code used to run PCA analyses for the proteomics data.
